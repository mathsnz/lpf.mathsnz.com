They understand that the attributes of area and perimeter are not dependent on each other.","exemplars":{"128":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040601.pdf","Title":"New carpet for the library"},"129":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040602.pdf","Title":"Sail for the yacht"},"130":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040604.pdf","Title":"The volume of boxes"},"131":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040605.pdf","Title":"Plastic buckets"}}},"140":{"Background":"The students deduce and use formulae to measure perimeter, area, and volume. They are able to separate a two-dimensional shape into familiar shapes to calculate area. They understand that the volume of a prism is calculated by measuring the area of the base and by multiplying that area by the prism\u2019s height. They calculate circumference from the measurement of diameter or radius, and they understand that the relationship between circumference and diameter (or radius) is a constant ratio. They understand the metric relationship of: 1 g = 1 ml= 1 cm\u00b3.","exemplars":{"132":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040701.pdf","Title":"Complex area"},"133":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040702.pdf","Title":"Triangular prisms"},"134":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040703.pdf","Title":"Calculating circumference"},"135":{"PDFFileUrl":"\/assets\/IllustrationPDFs\/M040704.pdf","Title":"The fish aquarium"}}},"141":{"Background":"The students can recognise the complexity of the attribute being measured and use correct units with precision.
